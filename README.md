# Search API

Search API (n√©e "rummager") indexes content into [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
and serves the GOV.UK Search API.

GOV.UK applications use the API to search and filter GOV.UK content.
For example, [alphagov/finder-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend) uses
the search API to render [site search](https://www.gov.uk/search) and finder pages
(such as [gov.uk/aaib-reports](https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports)).

Search API also provides a public API: https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json?q=taxes.

## API documentation

If you would like to use the Search API, please see the
[Search API documentation](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/apis/search/search-api.html).

You can also find some examples in the blog post:
["Use the search API to get useful information about GOV.UK content"](https://gdsdata.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/26/use-the-search-api-to-get-useful-information-about-gov-uk-content/).

## Technical documentation

Search API is a Sinatra application that interfaces with Elasticsearch.

You can use the [GOV.UK Docker environment](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) to run the application and its tests with all the necessary dependencies. Follow [the usage instructions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker#usage) to get started.

**Use GOV.UK Docker to run any commands that follow.**

### Running the test suite

```
bundle exec rake
```

### Dependencies

Search API depends on other services in order to index documents and provide
relevant search results:

- [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) - "You Know, for Search...".
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - used by indexing workers.
- [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) (optional) - used for [search relevancy](docs/relevancy.md)

If you use govuk-docker locally, the required dependencies will be started
automatically when you start Search API. You don't need to set these up yourself.

See the [learning to rank documentation](docs/learning-to-rank.md) for
guidance on how to run the ranking model locally.
